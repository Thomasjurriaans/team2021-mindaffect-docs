     * Text-to-speech

     * Word correction


Features
--------

.. _configurable-keyboard:

Adding a configurable JSON keyboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using this `keyboard editor <http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/>`_ custom .json files can be generated that are read into the program. Unlike normal keyboards only one character per key is allowed, much like mobile keyboards, since the BCI has no "shift" key.

More information on this can be found in :ref:`custom-keyboard-guide`

Word prediction and autocompletion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our word prediction and autocompletion module implements OpenAI's
`Generative Pretrained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) <https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/>`_
This model was trained to predict the next word in 40GB of internet text.

Word correction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our word correction module uses the `SpellChecker <https://pypi.org/project/pyspellchecker/>`_
module which is based on Peter Norvig's `blog post <https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html>`_
on setting up a simple spell checking algorithm.

English, Spanish, German, French and Portugese were already supported by this module. Our
module allows the user to add their own language if they have a word frequency file for
this language. We also implemented the option to download such a frequency list from a
`Git repository. <https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords>`_

Text to speech
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our text-to-speech module supports multiple TTS suppliers.

   * For offline use, the `pyttsx3 library <https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/>`_.

   * For online use, `gTTs <https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/>`_ can be used which uses Google Translate's TTS api.

   * For high quality paid online use, `Google WaveNet TTS <https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech>`_ is supported. Only credentials need to be provided.
