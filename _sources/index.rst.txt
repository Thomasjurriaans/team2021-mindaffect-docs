Features

.. _configurable-keyboard:

Adding a configurable JSON keyboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using this `keyboard editor <http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/>`_ custom .json files can be generated that are read into the program. Unlike normal keyboards only one character per key is allowed, much like mobile keyboards, since the BCI has no "shift" key.

More information on this can be found on the :ref:`custom-keyboard-guide`

Word prediction and autocompletion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The word prediction and autocompletion module uses n-gram frequency lists to predict what words the user is most likely to type next. Using this technique it is possible to easily create and use a custom frequency list for the user. This can enhance the user experience by suggesting for example the names of relatives whom the user wants to address.

Word correction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The word correction module uses the `SpellChecker <https://pypi.org/project/pyspellchecker/>`_ module which is based on Peter Norvig's `blog post <https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html>`_ on setting up a simple spell checking algorithm.

English, Spanish, German, French and Portugese were already supported by this module. The :ref:`word_correction` module allows the user to add their own language if they have a word frequency file for this language. We also implemented the option to download such a frequency list from a `Git repository. <https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords>`_

Text-to-speech
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our text-to-speech module supports multiple TTS suppliers.

   * For offline use, the `pyttsx3 library <https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/>`_.

   * For online use, `gTTs <https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/>`_ can be used which uses Google Translate's TTS api.

   * For high quality paid online use, `Google WaveNet TTS <https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech>`_ is supported. Only credentials need to be provided.
