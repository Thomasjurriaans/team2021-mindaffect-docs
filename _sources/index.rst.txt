Complete BCI spelling system
===============================================
Welcome to team2021-mindaffect's documentation!
-----------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------
This module implements a keyboard for the BCI system developed by MindAffect.
   * It supports adding your own configurable keyboard from a JSON file.
   * Multiple keyboards (sub-keyboards) can be used.
   * It is to be used cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux).
   * Predictive text: given the first few letters of a word,
     the user will be given the most likely options as 'keys' on the keyboard.
   * Text to speech: allows the user to say text out loud (with a 'say-out-loud' key).
   * Word correction: adds automatic correction of misspelled words with easy ability to
     undo.

Adding a configurable JSON keyboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using a `keyboard editor <http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/>`_ we can generate
custom .json files that can be read into the program. Unlike normal keyboards we only allow
one character per key, much like mobile keyboards, so no usage of shift to select a different
thing on the same key.

More information on this can be found in guide_to_creating_custom_json_keyboards.txt

Word prediction and autocompletion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our word prediction and autocompletion module implements OpenAI's
`Generative Pretrained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) <https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/>`_
This model was trained to predict the next word in 40GB of internet text.

Word correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our word correction module uses the `SpellChecker <https://pypi.org/project/pyspellchecker/>`_
module which is based on Peter Norvig's `blog post <https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html>`_
on setting up a simple spell checking algorithm.

English, Spanish, German, French and Portugese were already supported by this module. Our
module allows the user to add their own language if they have a word frequency file for
this language. We also implemented the option to download such a frequency list from a 
`Git repository. <https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords>`_

Text to speech
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our text-to-speech module uses the `pyttsx3 module <https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/>`_
which works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
If there is a connection to the internet, Google's `gTTs <https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/>`_
will be used.
