Installation
============

Instructions on how to install our module.

Something like

.. code-block:: python

   pip install team2021-mindaffect

.. note:: It will probably just be part of the pymindaffectbci module.


Requirements
------------
Our keyboard implementation is based on the `mindaffectbci module
<https://pypi.org/project/mindaffectBCI/>`_ developed by `MindAffect
<https://www.mindaffect.nl/>`_ so this should be installed.

.. code-block:: python

   pip install mindaffectBCI

The required packages can be found in requirements.txt and installed as follows.

.. code-block:: python

   pip install -r requirements.txt

We recommend using Python version 3.8

Problems
--------
First check if your Python version is not outdated and if all the required packages have
been installed correctly (see Requirements).

Add help here for possible problems that may arise with installation.
